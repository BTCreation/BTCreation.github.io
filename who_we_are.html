    <h3>The Right Combination of Resources</h3>
    <p>With a staff of experienced professionals, a 98,000 square-foot manufacturing facility, and the use of innovative manufacturing techniques, MSP is equipped to meet the security challenges faced by today's detention industry.

Our team of designers, project managers, fabricators, and mechanics makes MSP a full-service manufacturer, contractor and consultant. From specification writing and product evaluation to installation and maintenance, MSP provides a variety of services based on any project's needs.
</p>
  <h3>High Quality Products</h3>
  <p>MSP designs and manufactures high quality detention products from doors and heavy duty hinges to electronic controls. Our hollow steel door was the first to receive a three-hour fire rating from Underwriters Laboratories. This 10-gauge, hollow steel detention door has door stiffeners almost three times thicker than traditional hollow metal doors.

Our control systems are not only dependable but easily maintained. The user-friendly, hard-wired, relay logic control consoles are the most durable control systems available. MSP's Electronics Department also offers fully-integrated PLC systems, the new generation of computer-based controls.</p>
  <h3>On-Time Delivery</h3>
  <p>MSP maintains a long-standing reputation for on-time delivery. Since we manufacture our products, we have the flexibility to control the production schedule, and, as a result, product delivery. Our new and expanded manufacturing facility ensures MSP will continue to manufacture products not only on-budget, but on time.</p>
